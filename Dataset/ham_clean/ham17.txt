obviously way  sequence  menu     mark unseen  menu entry message   menu still wanting   function well   msgmark unseen  m sure missed need fix appdefaults  mark unseen   guess ll next cv fix     sequence defined  window widen    display sequence      chance lengthen instead  like exmh stuff   nice column  fit display better    use detached   folder list  one column  main exmh window take full screen    top bottom  le half width  etc  thought  first order approximation would add using pack  side top instead pack  side left  however  since different width  would look funny    space sequence   unseen  window  long   remain nice narrow window  best would sequence could   ordered preference  one nt fit would fall   bottom  shown       d also prefer window unusual background colouring    one constant colour  running unseen window   background black  root window black  border   decoration  made  sticky   appearance like   folder unseen message  count  written   root window  sticky  small display follows around   see new mail need processing   background color window background color ftoc    also find tend bunch sequence ever occur   one folder  forgotten ever created   addition    sequence always show   sequence never show     preference show sequence occur one folder   would useful  sequence occor   folder m visiting appear list folder current    keep list size somewhat manageable remaining   productive  quite often use sequence remember particular message   folder  name used  one message    give handle message remains folder   packed  sorted  etc   hmmm  let think    nt updated exmh time  m sure   next one new  new since numbernumber  sequence menu    bar new flist search   contains  unseen   urgent     would useful contained sequence folder   happens defined
