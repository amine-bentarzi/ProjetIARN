paul  apology irritable subject  ll tone rhetoric  quoting paul linehan  httpaddr    indeed  actually understood prior   example commercial entity triallimitedcrippled edition    problem  nt see problem  suse though  surely merrrier far re  concerned  anything either say motivation speculation  bearing disclaimer mind  s mine  make money selling boxed set  re glad make version available almostunrestricted distribution   value   via cd duplication internet estimate wo nt substitute boxedset sale  example  could packaged call  ftp edition  isonumber image  fact nt suggests see inconvenience mirroring ftp edition inumber file   moment  v numbernumber  motivation really determined buy boxed set  instead  likewise  could release v numbernumber  current  version  evaluation  singledisk iso image  instead  always keep several version behind  seems like incentive buy boxed set   evaluating  suse via iso image   speculation   motivation  know certainty permission ve granted  bit messy complex  nonetheless quite clear  permission  reminder  apply suseproduced component  yast  yastnumber  distribution installer program  possibly utility nt know  they wrote code  every right grant withhold permission suit best   one suspect one like  nt understand suse  proprietary extension nt prepared allow people  use gpl even freebsd style licence  hmm  let s slow   s persistent misconception s possible place somebody else s work new licence without permission   nothing copyright law would make possible  copyright owner inherent right  eg  software  work  entitled issue many instances code diverse licence wish   give copy licence statement  s effectively default licence operation copyright law  avoid going long digression  let say s proprietary licence default  s  order open source software  must explicit licence copyright holder   linux distribution ever entail relicensing people s software without explicit permission  since relicensing occur  get away taking suse linux ag s work redistributing claim bsd licence  gpl  anything copyright owner specified  simply lack right  claiming would copyright violation   thought model like suse selling support  customisation  rather thought core  product    thought like yast came core  maybe worked  glory day  say  number  understand might  want make money  way done  seems   spirit gpl  stallman friend gpl  let alone linus torvalds kernel contributor  intended prohibit putting gpled work cd proprietary one  selling result via retail store  plus mail order  etc   shrinkwrapped box  m number  certain could would done  guess   nt even require anybody give copy gpled component  ever   require if received gpled software lawfully  able get matching source code limited period  upon request  spirit gpl  say  d suggest stallman company knew exactly  degree access gpled software exactly mind   want o gnu apps  impression   those  one needed pay medium code     aije tort  mais si  indeed misconception  may want read text gpl verify fact  gpl not entitle copy binary software  section number provides right access matching source code if lawfully received copy covered binary  section provides three alternative mechanism distributor provide access  suse do actually provide exactly access  think case  believe s gpled codebase lawfully receive suse whose matching source code making available exactly required  please tell u codebase   would suse linux ag s headache   might interesting examine    understanding binary whatever could received  cost medium plus token one s appreciation  latter  subject agreement party   offering  bottle wine plus maybe pint two chat copy   nt know going rate  understanding almost correct  quite   number  access provision gpl concern access source code  binary   number  kick only people ve lawfully received covered binary   number  covered software mean instance codebases actually placed gnu gpl copyright owner  mere act placing piece software cdrom gpled software nt gpl  fact  assertion contrary favourite fud tactic enemy linux  re forever trying convince software producer using gpled software way proprietary offering  taint  copyright force put
